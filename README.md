# Here is a portfolio project for Social Engineering using Python. This code will demonstrate how to use Python and various libraries to perform social engineering attacks.

This code demonstrates a simple social engineering attack using Python. Here's how it works:

The send_email function is defined to send an email with an image attachment. It takes the sender's email address, recipient's email address, email subject, email body, and the path to the image file.

The capture_screenshot function is defined to capture a screenshot using the pyautogui library. It takes the filename to save the screenshot.

In the main function:

1. The sender's email address, recipient's email address, email subject, and email body are defined.
2. The capture_screenshot function is called to capture a screenshot and save it as 'screenshot.png'.
3. The send_email function is called with the defined parameters to send the email.
4. The code assumes that the sender's email account is configured to allow access from less secure apps. If not, you may need to generate an app password for the sender's email account.

Make sure to replace 'example@gmail.com' with your own email address and 'victim@example.com' with the email address of the intended recipient.

The code uses the Gmail SMTP server to send the email. If you're using a different email provider, you may need to adjust the SMTP server settings accordingly.

The code uses the 'password' placeholder for the sender's email password. Make sure to replace 'password' with the actual password of the sender's email account.

This code provides a basic example of how Python can be used for social engineering. It demonstrates how to capture screenshots, send emails with attachments, and perform basic social engineering techniques.

However, please note that this code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities !!!
